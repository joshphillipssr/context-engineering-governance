# Issue Linkage (Outcome-Based, Required)
- [ ] Exactly one primary tracked issue is declared using `Primary-Issue-Ref: Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>` or `Primary-Issue-Ref: Refs #<ISSUE_NUMBER>`
- [ ] Primary issue shows this PR in GitHub Development before merge, or an explicit exception with compensating evidence is documented
- [ ] `gh issue develop <ISSUE_NUMBER> --checkout` was used where practical (recommended, not mandatory)

# Development Linkage Evidence (Required)
- Development-Linkage: Verified
- Development-Linkage-Evidence:
- If exception is required instead of verified linkage:
  - Development-Linkage: Exception
  - Development-Linkage-Evidence: <why linkage is blocked + compensating evidence>

# ADR Linkage (Required for architecture/protected changes)
- ADR-Required: No
- Primary-ADR: N/A
- ADR-Status-At-Merge: N/A
- ADR-Exception-Evidence: N/A
- ADR-Supersession-Traceability: N/A
- Set `ADR-Required: Yes` when this PR introduces or changes architecture decisions, protected-path policy/process decisions, or operating-model structure.
- `Primary-ADR` must reference an ADR artifact using either canonical filename (`0001-...`) or `ADR-<ID>`.
- `ADR-Status-At-Merge` allowed values: `Accepted | Exception | N/A`.
- If `ADR-Status-At-Merge: Exception`, provide explicit compensating evidence in `ADR-Exception-Evidence` and ensure Executive Sponsor approval is recorded before merge.
- If this PR replaces a prior decision, set `ADR-Supersession-Traceability` to `Supersedes: <ADR-ID>` or `Superseded-By: <ADR-ID>` (otherwise `N/A`).
