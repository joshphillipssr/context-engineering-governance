# Workflow

## Default Workflow (Reviewable Changes)
1. **Issue**: Objective, scope, constraints, definition of done
2. **Branch + Linkage (required)**: Create a branch linked to the primary Issue using any valid GitHub path (recommended: `gh issue develop <ISSUE_NUMBER> --checkout`)
3. **Implementation**: Focused edits with minimal scope and role-attributed commit messages
4. **Pull Request**: Use templates + include machine-readable PR metadata (`Primary-Role` / `Reviewed-By-Role` / `Executive-Sponsor-Approval`) and link/close the Issue (example: `Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>`). For architecture/protected changes, include ADR linkage fields (`ADR-Required`, `Primary-ADR`, `ADR-Status-At-Merge`, `ADR-Supersession-Traceability`)
5. **Labels**: Apply required PR labels (at least one `role:*` label + exactly one `status:*` label) using GitHub UI, API/automation, or `gh` immediately after PR creation
6. **Review**: Compliance Officer review + human decision where required; Compliance Officer posts PR Review Report comment; reviewer updates status labels after verdict; AI Governance Manager / Executive Sponsor makes final call for sensitive changes
7. **Merge**: Human merge for protected changes; update status labels

## Required Rules
- Every PR must map to an existing Issue.
- Primary issue routing must follow `00-os/intake-routing.md` (`context-engineering-governance` for governance changes; `context-engineering-implementation` for execution/tooling changes).
- Every PR must declare one primary tracked Issue in the PR description using `Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>` or `Refs #<ISSUE_NUMBER>`.
- Legacy `Context-Engineering` issues may be linked only as historical references and cannot be the primary tracked issue for new split-repo PRs.
- The primary tracked Issue must show PR linkage in GitHub Development before merge; if platform behavior prevents this, document the exception and compensating evidence in the PR.
- `gh issue develop <ISSUE_NUMBER> --checkout` is recommended, but not the only allowed branch-linking path.
- Issues must define objective, scope, constraints, and definition of done.
- Architecture/protected changes must declare ADR linkage in the PR (`ADR-Required: Yes`, `Primary-ADR`, `ADR-Status-At-Merge`) or provide an approved exception path.
- Replacing decisions must include supersession traceability in PR metadata and reciprocal ADR linkage updates.

## Issue/PR Triage
- **Blocker**: must be resolved in the current PR before approval/merge.
- **Follow-up**: create a linked Issue; keep the current PR scoped.
- **Note**: keep as a note/checklist/comment; no new Issue required unless promoted to follow-up.

## Protected Changes (Require Executive Sponsor Approval)
- `governance.md` and `context-flow.md`
- Anything under `00-os/`
- Any change that affects Plane A vs Plane B boundaries
- Protected architecture/process decisions must have an accepted ADR (or explicit Executive Sponsor-approved exception evidence) before merge

## Low-Risk Fast-Track (If Review Gate Passes)
- New templates under `10-templates/`
- Placeholder vendor notes under `30-vendor-notes/`
- New session canvas instances under `20-canvases/`

## Default Behaviors
- Prefer templates and checklists over prose.
- Add TODOs when judgment is required.
- Keep Plane A/Plane B separation intact.
- For architecture decisions, use ADR artifacts in `00-os/adr/` and follow `00-os/adr/AUTHORING.md`.
- For ADR supersession, verify reciprocal fields (`Supersedes` and `Superseded-By`) and include `ADR-Supersession-Traceability` in the PR body.

## Artifact Flow
- Session Canvas → Publishable Extract → Repo Canvas

## Role Creation Workflow
- Canonical execution template: `10-templates/agent-work-orders/role-creation-work-order.md`
- GitHub issue launcher: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/role-creation-request.md`
- Use this pair for end-to-end role rollout work (charter and source definitions through role-repo sync and container publish verification).
- Ensure role creation work includes workstation launcher touchpoints when introducing new roles.

## TODO
- Add release cadence (weekly/monthly) if needed.
- Define acceptance criteria for each artifact type.
